    The Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is a renowned reserve all over India. It is one of the premiers in Indian Biosphere Reserves. The Pachmarhi area was designated as a biosphere reserve by the Government of India on the basis of project document prepared by the Environmental Planning and Coordination Organisation (EPCO). The EPCO is an advisory body to the State Government of Madhya Pradesh.

    Apart from the rich flora, the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve also has a great collection of several fauna species. The faunal composition of the reserve represents the Deccan Peninsular zone of bio-geographic classification of India. Though the major animals like Lions, Elephants, Wild Buffaloes and Barasingas were present here in the past, they have disappeared now. As most of the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is covered with dense forest vegetation, it forms an ideal habitat for the wild animals. The reserve is home to 42 tigers, 74 panthers, 3475 wild boar, 964 barking deers, 1223 guars, 981 Cheetals, 981 samphars, 1282 Rhesus macaque, 6 crocodiles and several other animal species. The reptiles like lizards, gecleos, skinks, amphibia etc. are also found in this reserve. The animals like Rhesus Monkeys, Giant Squirrels, and Flying Squirrels are endemic to the area and the Crested Serpent Eagles are also rarely found in the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve.

    The name Pachmarhi is believed to be derived from the Hindi words Panch ("five") and Marhi ("caves"). According to a legend, these caves were built by five Pandava brothers of Mahabharatha era during their thirteen years of exile.[citation needed] The caves are situated on a hilltop and provide an excellent vantage point.

Pachmadhi region was Ruled by Bhonsale Kings।. It came under Marathas in the 18th century under SenaSahebSubha Maharaj Raghuji Raje Bhonsale।.
