  <div class="bg-text"><h1>WELCOME TO THE NORTH-EASTERN PART OF INDIA</h1></div>
</div>

<P><B>Northeast India, officially known as the North Eastern Region (NER) is the easternmost region of 
  India representing both a geographic and political administrative division of the country. It comprises 
  eight states—Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (commonly known
   as the "Seven Sisters"), and the "brother" state of Sikkim.
</p>
<p>The region shares an international border of 5,182 kilometres (3,220 mi) (about 99 per cent of its total
   geographical boundary) with several neighbouring countries – 1,395 kilometres (867 mi) with China in the
    north, 1,640 kilometres (1,020 mi) with Myanmar in the east, 1,596 kilometres (992 mi) with Bangladesh
     in the south-west, 97 kilometres (60 mi) with Nepal in the west, and 455 kilometres (283 mi) with
      Bhutan in the north-west. It comprises an area of 262,184 square kilometres (101,230 sq mi), almost
       8 per cent of that of India. The Siliguri Corridor connects the region to the rest of mainland 
       India.
       <p>The states of North Eastern Region are officially recognised under the North Eastern Council (NEC),
       constituted in 1971 as the acting agency for the development of the north eastern states. Long after
        induction of NEC, Sikkim formed part of the North Eastern Region as the eighth state in 2002.
         India's Look-East connectivity projects connect Northeast India to East Asia and ASEAN. The city 
         of Guwahati in Assam is referred to as the "Gateway to the Northeast" and is the largest metropolis
          in Northeast India.</p>
        <p>
          Seven Sister States
The Seven Sister States is a popular term for the contiguous states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya,
 Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura prior to inclusion of the state of Sikkim into the North Eastern 
 Region of India. The sobriquet 'Land of the Seven Sisters' was coined to coincide with the inauguration of
  the new states in January 1972 by Jyoti Prasad Saikia,[42] a journalist in Tripura, in the course of a
   radio talk show. He later compiled a book on the interdependence and commonness of the Seven Sister
    States. It has been primarily because of this publication that the nickname has caught on.</p>
