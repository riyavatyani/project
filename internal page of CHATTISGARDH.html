    <h1>RAIPUR</h1>
    <video autoplay muted loop src="bg video raipur.mp4">
    </video>
    <div class="wf">
        Raipur  is the capital city of the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. Raipur is also the administrative headquarters of Raipur district and Raipur division, and the largest city of the state. It was a part of Madhya Pradesh before the state of Chhattisgarh was formed on 1 November 2000.[5] It is a major commercial hub for trade and commerce in the region. It has exponential industrial growth and has become a major business hub in Central India. It has been ranked as India's 6th cleanest city as per the Swachh Survekshan for the year 2021.[6] Raipur is ranked 7th in the Ease of Living Index 2019 and 7th in the Municipal Performance Index 2020, both by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
        
            <h2>Climate</h2>
            Raipur has a tropical wet and dry climate, temperatures remain moderate throughout the year, except from March to June, which can be extremely hot. The temperature in April–May sometimes rises above 48 °C (118 °F). These summer months also have dry and hot winds. The city receives about 1,300 millimetres (51 in) of rain, mostly in the monsoon season from late June to early October. Winters last from November to January and are mild, although lows can fall to 5 °C (41 °F) making it reasonably cold.


            <h2>Plant and animal life</h2>
            <img class="assm" src="raipur image 1.png">
    The eastern and southeastern borderlands of Chhattisgarh are characterized by moist deciduous plantlife, but toward the interior of the state this flora is replaced by dry deciduous vegetation, often degenerating locally into scrub. The most valuable hardwoods are teak and sal (Shorea robusta). A type of tree called salai yields a resin used for incense and medicine, while leaves from tendu trees are used for rolling bidi (Indian cigarettes). Bamboo is abundant and is harvested for many purposes.

The forests are home to a broad array of animals, including tigers, striped hyenas, and blackbucks. Other species include the chital (spotted deer), gaur (a type of wild buffalo), sambar deer, sloth bear, wild boar, and four-horned antelope, among others. The woodlands are also inhabited by many species of birds. Chhattisgarh has a number of national parks and many wildlife sanctuaries. The Indravati National Park contains a wildlife sanctuary for tigers.

Chhattisgarh supports a population of diverse ethnic, social, religious, and linguistic backgrounds. More than one-third of the state’s residents officially belong to the Scheduled Castes (groups formerly called “untouchables” within the Indian caste system) or to the Scheduled Tribes (indigenous minority peoples who are not embraced by the caste hierarchy). Of the Scheduled Tribes, the Gond peoples are most prominent.

The vast majority of Chhattisgarh’s people practice Hinduism, but there are sizable minorities of Muslims, Jains, Christians, and Buddhists. There also is a small community of Sikhs. Chhattisgarhi is the most widely spoken language, followed by Hindi; both are official languages of the state. Many of the Gond speak Gondi. Marathi, Urdu, Oriya, Gujarati, and Punjabi are spoken by significant numbers.
Chhattisgarh is mineral-rich. Although many of the state’s resources remain to be exploited fully, its major reserves of coal, iron ore, limestone, bauxite, and dolomite, as well as its significant deposits of tin, manganese ore, gold, and copper, make the mining industry a major source of income. In fact, Chhattisgarh is one of the country’s largest suppliers of dolomite. Its iron ore, which is of top quality, is found primarily in the south-central and southern parts of the state. Deposits of diamonds have been discovered near Raipur.
