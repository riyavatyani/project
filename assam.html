    <h1>ASSAM</h1>
    <video autoplay muted loop src="N-E.mp4">

    <div class="wf">
        Assam, state of India. It is located in the northeastern part of the country and is bounded to the
         north by the kingdom of Bhutan and the state of Arunachal Pradesh, to the east by the states of
          Nagaland and Manipur, to the south by the states of Mizoram and Tripura, and to the west by 
          Bangladesh and the states of Meghalaya and West Bengal. The name Assam is derived from the word 
          asama, meaning “peerless” in the now extinct Ahom language. The neighbouring states of Arunachal
           Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Meghalaya were once part of Assam. The capital, formerly Shillong
            (now the capital of Meghalaya), was shifted to Dispur, a suburb of Guwahati, in 1972. Area 
            30,285 square miles.
            <h2>Climate</h2>
Average temperatures in Assam range from highs in the upper 90s F (about 36 °C) in August to lows in the
 mid-40s F (about 7 °C) in January. The cool season generally lasts from October to February and is marked 
 by fogs and brief showers. The state escapes the normal Indian hot, dry season. Although some rain occurs
  from March through May, the heaviest precipitation comes with the southwest monsoon, which arrives in June
  , stays through September, and often causes widespread and destructive flooding. Annual rainfall in Assam
   is not only the highest in the country but also ranks among the highest in the world; its annual average
    varies from about 70 inches (1,800 mm) in the west to more than 120 inches (3,000 mm) in the east.
    <h2>Plant and animal life</h2>
    <img class="assm" src="all photos/assm.jpg">
 formerly extending over nearly two-fifths of the state’s area, were reduced by the creation of
 Meghalaya and Mizoram in the early 1970s. In the early 21st century about one-third of Assam was covered
  with various types of woodlands, including tropical evergreen and deciduous forests, broad-leaved hill 
  forests, pine forests, and swamp forests, as well as grasslands. Assam is home to some 75 species of trees
  , many of which have commercial value. Sal (Shorea robusta) and hollong (Dipterocarpus rhetusus) trees are
   among the most bountiful of the hardwoods. Bamboo, orchids, and ferns also are abundant.

Assam has numerous wildlife sanctuaries, the most prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites—the
 Kaziranga National Park (designated in 1985), on the bank of the Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife
  Sanctuary (designated in 1992), near the border with Bhutan. Both are refuges for the fast-disappearing
   Indian one-horned rhinoceros, and the sanctuary at Manas is known especially for its tigers and leopards.
    Among the other notable inhabitants of Assam’s forests are elephants, gaurs (wild oxen), wild pigs,
     various species of deer, and primates, such as langurs and hoolock gibbons. Common birds include
      cormorants, herons, ducks, and other water birds, as well as warblers, thrushes, owls, and peacocks. 
      Hornbills are characteristic of Assam, although they are endangered in some areas. The state also has
       dozens of species of reptiles, including poisonous snakes, such as kraits, cobras, and vipers; an 
       array of lizards, skinks, and geckos; and many types of turtles.

        <h2 id="hs"> PANIMUR WATERFALL</h2>
        <article>
        <span class="high">Panimur</span> is situated at Haflong, the only hill station in Assam. Known as the ‘Niagara Falls 
        of Assam’, the waterfall is formed from the Kopili River. The gushing milky white waterfall 
        is undoubtedly an ethereal beauty. If you want a panoramic scene, you should explore this
         magnificent waterfall.
        Panimur is a renowned location owing its reputation to the multitude of waterfalls and rapids 
        along the Kopili river. The colour of the water ranges from turquoise to kerosene-blue depending
         on the seasons and is a prime location for sightseeing, picnics, camping and other tourist
          activities. It is located about 120 kilometers from Haflong and is well-connected by roads. 
          This location is also revered by the Dimasa tribe as a pilgrimage site where they take holy
           baths on every Magh Purnima. <br><br>
           <img class="first" src="all photos/waterfall.jpg"><br><br>
            the cleanest waterfall in Assam, the Panimur Waterfall located in the Dima Haso 
           district, will purify your heart and body. Best to visit during the winter season when there
            is no rainfall, the water in the Panimur Waterfall is crystal clear.
           <h3> How to reach Panimur waterfall?</h3>
        Reaching Panimur waterfall will depend on where you are starting your journey. We will discuss different 
        starting points from Guwahati, Shillong, Silchar, Dimapur, and Haflong. Please note that in all options,
        the public transportation option is out of the question as it is not a good option for tourists. The best
        option is to rent a bike or a car from your starting point and directly go to Panimur waterfall. Or,
        reach to the nearest railway station (New Haflong) and hire a taxi to reach there. Technically, there
        are nearer railway stations such as Lanka but not all trains stop there.
