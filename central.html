<P><B>Central India is a loosely defined region in India that includes the states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. It's also known as Madhya Bharat. Thus the Central Zonal Council set up by the Indian government includes both these states, plus Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand to the north, the last taking the region to the border with Tibet/China in the Himalayas.


</p>
   
<p>"Central India" on a north-south axis, making it the part of India that is south of North India and north of South India; the definition of North India also varies hugely, but that of South India is generally agreed. This definition includes either some or all of the Deccan, in particular Maharashtra, and may or may not include some of the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the north. 

</P>
  
<p>"Central India" as Madhya Pradesh and "eastern and central Uttar Pradesh"."Madhya Pradesh" means "central province", while "Uttar Pradesh" means "northern province", though when adopted in 1950 it had the advantage of preserving the common "UP" abbreviation for what was formerly the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.</p></B>
